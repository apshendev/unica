# Release runbook

How to publish a Unica version to the public marketplace, and why each step
exists. Follow it top to bottom; every step states what to verify before moving
on.

Two repositories are involved:

- `IngvarConsulting/unica` — source, runtime assets, release automation.
- `IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace` — the public catalog consumers install
  from.

## Core release provenance

The release workflow derives the core runtime owner from the repository it
runs in (`CORE_RELEASE_REPOSITORY: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}`)
and passes it to both `build-unica-tools.py` and `package-unica-plugin.py`
(`--core-release-repository`). On upstream this resolves to the same address
the packager default names, so nothing changes for existing callers. A fork
checkout names itself and must build both the bootstrap and the manifest with
that same input — a manifest naming one owner never validates against a
bootstrap built for another (`CTR.PKG.CORE-PROVENANCE-SELECTABLE`). Engine
deliveries stay pinned to the toolchain repository regardless.

## OpenCode npm publication

Tagged releases of this fork also publish the OpenCode candidate
`@apshendev/unica-opencode` to npm. The `publish-opencode-npm` job runs after
the runtime assets are published **and** re-verified, only on a tag push, and
only when `github.repository == 'apshendev/unica'` — the same workflow file on
upstream skips the job, and the aggregate gate expects it skipped there.
Authentication is npm trusted publishing: the job carries
`permissions: id-token: write` and npm (>= 11.5, from the Node 24 runner)
exchanges the short-lived OIDC token for the publish. No long-lived npm token
exists in this repository, and `publish-unica-opencode.py` re-checks the
repository, event, ref, and package identity before invoking npm
(`INV.PKG.NPM-PUBLICATION-GATE`).

One-time prerequisites, done by the package owner:

1. **Claim the package.** Trusted publishers are configured in an existing
   package's settings, so the name must be claimed first: publish the tagged
   candidate once manually (`npm publish <tarball> --access public`, logged
   in with 2FA — no CI token needed), or `npm org`/UI equivalent for your
   account. This one publish predates trusted publishing; every later
   version goes through the workflow.
2. **Link the trusted publisher.** In the package settings on npmjs.com add
   a trusted publisher for the GitHub repository `apshendev/unica` with the
   workflow filename `unica-plugin-release.yml` (no directory prefix) and no
   environment. From that moment the workflow's OIDC token is the only
   credential that can publish.

Until step 2 exists, a tagged release fails its npm job with an
authorization error and nothing is published.

A rerun of a release whose npm version already exists succeeds only when the
registry tarball is byte-identical to the candidate (`npm view dist.tarball`,
download, SHA-512 compare; `INV.PKG.NPM-RERUN-INTEGRITY`). SemVer prereleases
publish under the `next` dist-tag so `latest` never serves one, mirroring the
GitHub prerelease marking. Any other outcome — an integrity mismatch or an
npm failure — leaves the workflow red; the tag and the runtime assets are
never deleted or rewritten by this pipeline. The upstream Codex and Claude
Code marketplace promotion is a separate workflow this one does not touch.

## Why publication has two phases

The catalog must never point at bytes that are not final. If it moved in the
same step that published them, a partial or unverified upload would be served to
every consumer immediately.

The release workflow and its contract tests therefore split publication:

1. **Stage** — put the plugin bytes on the marketplace default branch. The
   catalog still names the previous tag, so no consumer is affected yet.
2. **Promote** — move the catalog to the new tag. This is the moment the release
   goes live.

Between the two sits an immutable tag the catalog pins `git-subdir` to, which
`scripts/verify_marketplace.py` in the marketplace repo enforces.

## One human action, one linear pipeline

The workflow runs the whole publication as one pass of **Publish Unica
Marketplace**, started automatically when the tag-triggered build succeeds:

| You | The pipeline |
| --- | --- |
| Step 0 — set the version | |
| Step 1 — tag the source release | build → assets → BSP assessment |
| | stage the payload (catalog untouched) |
| | create the anchor tag on the staging commit |
| | consumer install checks: fresh + upgrade, three hosts |
| | green → move the catalog → **live** |
| Step 3 — merge the line back into `main` | |

Your signed source tag is the human approval and the cryptographic anchor of
the release. Be honest about what enforces it: the pipeline proves the tag
exists and that the payload came from its successful push build, but it does
not verify the signature itself — GitHub reports these signatures as
unverified today. What keeps the tag trustworthy is write access and the
repository's tag protection rules; keep those protections on. The marketplace
tag is created by the pipeline: it is the ref the catalog resolves, and
nothing verifies its signature — the runbook used to ask for a second signed
tag, and ADR-0068 retired it.

There is no scheduler and no waiting window: a failed stage is a red run
attached to the release tag, and the catalog stays where it was. Rerunning the
failed workflow resumes the publication — every stage is idempotent.

## Preconditions

- Write access to both repositories, and `gh` authenticated. The tag step
  pushes over HTTPS, so run `gh auth setup-git` once in a fresh checkout.
- A GPG key able to sign the source tag. If signing fails with `Operation
  cancelled` in a non-interactive shell, run
  `gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye` first, then
  `echo test | gpg --clearsign > /dev/null` to unlock the agent.
- The branch the release is cut from is green, and the version bump is ready
  to verify and merge.

## Where a release is cut from

A minor is cut from `main`. Patches for a minor that already shipped are cut
from its line branch, `release-vX.Y`, and that branch is where the version bump
lives: `main` keeps the minor's version and never takes the patch bumps. When
0.12.3 shipped, `release-v0.12` declared 0.12.3 while `main` still declared
0.12.0.

Steps 0 and 1 therefore happen on the branch the release is cut from, and the
tag names a commit on it. Step 3 brings the line back to `main`.

## Step 0 — prepare the version

One command writes the version everywhere the package contract declares it, then
runs the contract check:

```bash
python3.12 scripts/dev/bump-version.py X.Y.Z
cargo update --workspace --offline
```

The version lives in several files because each is read by a different consumer:
Cargo compiles it into the binaries, the two host manifests ship it to Codex and
Claude Code, and the tools lock pins it beside the third-party tools. They are
separate artifacts, so it cannot live in one file — but it is written by one
command and enforced by one check,
`scripts/ci/check-version-contract.py`, which fails the build if any of them
drift apart.

Tests that assert the current version still need updating by hand; they fail with
an explicit diff, so run the suite before opening the pull request:

```bash
python3.12 -m pip install -r tests/ci/requirements.txt
python3.12 -m unittest discover -s tests/ci
```

Then merge through a pull request into the branch the release is cut from.
Keep the bump its own pull request: step 1 tags its merge commit, so that commit
has to carry both the bump and everything else the version ships.

## Step 1 — tag the source release

Tag the merge commit of the version pull request in `unica` and push. On a
patch that commit is on `release-vX.Y`, not on `main`. The tag triggers the
release build, and the successful build starts the publication pipeline on its
own.

```bash
git tag -s vX.Y.Z <release-commit-sha> -m "Unica vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The version must be fixed before artifacts are built: the runtime manifest
embeds `release.tag` and derives every asset URL from it, and the bootstrap
rejects a manifest whose URL disagrees with its declared version.

## Step 2 — watch it land

The tag push runs **Build Unica Codex Plugin**, and its success triggers
**Publish Unica Marketplace**: stage → tag → verify → promote.

### What the release carries

Only the core is built here, so only the core is published here:

| On the GitHub release | Count | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unica-runtime-<target>.tar.gz` | 3 | the core, one archive per target |
| `unica-runtime-<target>.json` | 3 | what the core pins: version, asset, SHA-256, file closure |

Six assets, and both halves have a reader: `verify-published-assets` re-downloads
each pair and rehashes every member. Descriptions of the *engine* artifacts stay
inside the build — the packager reads them from the workflow artifact, and on the
release they would be a third copy of facts already in `tools.lock.json` at the
source tag and in the published plugin's `runtime-manifest.json`, naming an asset
this release does not carry.

Engines are **named, not republished**. Their bytes live in `unica-toolchain`
releases, and the runtime manifest points at them by address and SHA-256; the
plugin release used to carry a second copy, 439 MB of it per release, for no
gain. See
[`DEC.2026-08-20.ENGINES-COME-FROM-THE-TOOLCHAIN`](../arch/decisions/2026-08-20-engines-come-from-the-toolchain.md).

That splits verification three ways, and each part is a job in the build:

| What | Checked by | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| core bytes | `verify-published-assets` | re-downloads the release assets and rehashes every member |
| every asset address | `verify-published-assets` | HEAD on all twelve URLs the manifest names, across all three targets |
| the whole delivery | `smoke-thin-plugin` (linux-x64) | `unica-bootstrap prefetch` — address, checksum and layout, end to end |

The address check exists because the toolchain bytes are verified when the build
downloads them, and nothing touches the address after that: a typo in a tag would
otherwise surface at a user's first engine call.

```bash
gh run list --workflow "Build Unica Codex Plugin" --limit 3 \
  --json databaseId,headBranch,conclusion
gh run list --workflow "Publish Unica Marketplace" --limit 3 \
  --json databaseId,conclusion
```

The release is live when the catalog names the new tag — both host catalogs
move in the same commit:

```bash
gh api repos/IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace/contents/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep '"ref"'
```

The marketplace repository runs its own **Verify marketplace** on every push it
receives, so `stage`, `tag` and `promote` each leave a run there, after the
fact. Those runs do not gate anything: the pipeline's `verify-upgrade` and
`verify-fresh-install` jobs already ran on three hosts before `promote` moved
the catalog.

## Step 3 — merge the line back into `main`

A patch leaves `main` behind, because the fix and the bump landed on the line
branch only. Merge the line back through a `merge/release-vX.Y.Z-into-main`
pull request once the release is live.

The version contract conflicts every time. Keep `main`'s side in all five files:
the line changed nothing there but the number. `Cargo.lock` conflicts for the
same reason and also keeps `main`'s side, which carries the real dependency
state while the line moved only the two workspace crate versions.

## If a stage fails

The pipeline stops before the catalog moves, so consumers are unaffected.
Rerun the whole workflow after fixing the cause — completed stages detect
themselves and pass through:

```bash
gh run rerun <publish-run-id> --failed
```

To run the pipeline for a build that already succeeded (for example after the
`workflow_run` trigger was missed), dispatch it with the build's run id:

```bash
gh workflow run publish-unica-marketplace.yml --repo IngvarConsulting/unica \
  -f source_run_id=<build-run-id>
```

## What consumers see, and when

Only one step changes anything for consumers. Everything before it is invisible
to them, which is what makes aborting cheap.

| After | Visible to consumers |
| --- | --- |
| source tag pushed | nothing |
| assets published | nothing — no catalog names them |
| payload staged | nothing — the catalog still names the previous tag |
| anchor tag pushed | nothing |
| install checks green | nothing |
| **catalog moved** | **the release is live** |

## A prerelease: built, published, never served

Some things can only be measured against a real release — a runtime manifest
pins its assets to `github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica/releases/download/<tag>/`,
so nothing but a published tag will do. A prerelease is the release that exists
for us and not for consumers.

Give the version a SemVer prerelease suffix and tag it as usual:

```bash
python3.12 scripts/dev/bump-version.py 0.13.0-rc.1
cargo update --workspace --offline
# merge, then tag as in step 1
```

The suffix is part of the version, not a label beside it, because the runtime
manifest requires the tag to equal `v` + the plugin version literally.

What the pipeline does with it:

| Stage | Prerelease |
| --- | --- |
| build, assets on the GitHub release | runs — and marks the release as a prerelease |
| stage, anchor tag, install checks, promote | **skipped** |

The publish workflow asks first: its `gate` job reads the source tag and stops
the whole publication when the tag carries a suffix. Nothing is disabled by
hand, so a colleague tagging a real release meanwhile is unaffected.

A prerelease burns its own version number, never the stable one: measure
against `0.13.0-rc.1`, then release `0.13.0` from the same code. "The same
code" still means a second bump pull request — the version is part of the
package contract, so `0.13.0` is a commit, not a relabelling of `0.13.0-rc.1`.

Two things follow from engines being named rather than republished. The
measurement is cheaper than it looks: engine artifacts keep their own versions,
so `0.13.0-rc.1` and `0.13.0` name the same engine bytes, and a machine that
warmed its cache on the prerelease downloads nothing but the core for the
stable. And the prerelease's own assets are only the core — the toolchain
releases it points at are already published and are not touched.

Keep it marked as a prerelease — it is not a release waiting to be served, and
`gh release view` without a tag must keep naming the last stable one.

Two things the gate does not stop, and you should not attempt:

- **Dispatching the publish pipeline for a prerelease build.** The `gate` job
  reads the tag, not the trigger, so a manual `source_run_id` is refused the
  same way the automatic trigger is. Nothing breaks; nothing publishes either.
- **Pointing the catalog at a prerelease by hand.** The forward-only guard sorts
  with `sort -V`, which ranks `v0.13.0-rc.1` *above* `v0.13.0`. A catalog naming
  the prerelease would make the stable release look like a rollback, and both
  `stage` and `promote` would refuse it — the release after it could not ship.

## One-way doors

Two things can never be taken back once published, because other artifacts
reference them by identity:

- **Release assets** in `unica`. Runtime manifests pin them by SHA-256.
- **Release assets in `unica-toolchain`.** Published Unica versions name them by
  address and SHA-256, so deleting a toolchain release, moving its tag, or
  re-uploading an asset under the same name breaks every Unica version that
  pinned it — including versions released long ago. Toolchain releases are as
  immutable as this repository's own.
- **Tags** in either repository. Consumers resolve `git-subdir` against them.

This gives the rule that replaces rollback: **never reuse a version number**. If
anything is wrong after step 1, abandon that version and release the next patch
instead. Re-cutting `vX.Y.Z` with different bytes breaks every consumer that
already resolved it.

Whenever you abandon a version whose assets are already published, mark that
release so it stops looking like a release waiting to be served:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --repo IngvarConsulting/unica --prerelease
```

Never delete a tag to "clean up" an abandoned version. An unused tag costs
nothing; a deleted one that something already resolved costs every consumer.

## Rolling back a live release

Reverting is a one-file change, and it works because published bytes never move,
so the previous tag still resolves to exactly what it always did.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IngvarConsulting/unica-marketplace.git /tmp/unica-marketplace
cd /tmp/unica-marketplace
git revert --no-edit <promotion-commit-sha>
git push origin main
```

Confirm the catalog names the previous tag again, then treat the bad version as
burnt and fix forward in the next patch. Consumers move back on their next
update; those who already installed the bad version keep it until then, so
prefer fixing forward when the fault is not severe.

## The one state to avoid

A catalog that names a tag which does not exist. Every install then fails with
`pathspec 'vX.Y.Z' did not match any file(s)`, including for consumers who had
been working fine.

The pipeline cannot reach it — the promote job requires the tag job — so it has
one remaining cause, which is preventable outright by protecting tags in the
marketplace repository: deleting or moving a published tag by hand.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publish run failed at `stage` or `tag` | Transient push failure or a moved branch | `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`; stages are idempotent |
| Publish run failed at the install checks | The candidate does not install as a consumer | Fix forward; the version is burnt, the catalog never moved |
| `tag` fails on an existing tag | The version was already published with different bytes | Never move the tag; release the next patch |
| Packaging fails with `release tag vX.Y.Z != vA.B.C` | The tagged commit does not declare X.Y.Z: step 0 was not merged, or the wrong commit was tagged | Tag the merge commit of the version pull request. If the bad tag was pushed, that version is burnt — take the next patch |
| `Verify marketplace` red after the catalog moved, at `previous-stable-upgrade` with `git clone marketplace source timed out after 30s` | Codex re-clones the whole marketplace on `plugin marketplace upgrade`; a clone that misses its own 30s budget leaves the stale local catalog, which then installs the previous version | Transient. `gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`. Consumers are unaffected: the catalog is already correct and the pipeline's own upgrade checks passed before promote |
| Consumers still report the old version | The publish run did not finish | Check its failed stage and rerun |
| `verify-delivery-reachable` fails with HTTP 404 | The toolchain asset the lock names is gone or was renamed | Never re-tag a toolchain release; point the lock at a published asset and cut the next patch |
| The prefetch step fails on a checksum | Toolchain bytes were replaced under a published name | Treat the toolchain release as burnt, publish a new toolchain build, bump the lock |
| `build-tools` fails while downloading a tool asset | The lock names a toolchain tag that does not exist yet | Publish the toolchain release first; the lock may only pin what is already public |

## Never

- Move or delete a published tag, or force-push the marketplace default branch.
  Consumers resolve `git-subdir` against those refs; changed bytes require a new
  version.
- Point the catalog at a tag by hand. The promote job is the only writer of the
  catalog files, and it runs only behind green install checks.
