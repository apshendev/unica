# Unica Visual Kit

- `index.html` — primary long-form Brand Canvas
- `logos/` — background-specific SVGs, transparent SVGs, alpha PNG logo sizes, and PNG mark sizes
- `wallpapers/`, `ads/`, `social/` — ready placements and full-bleed social avatars
- `unica-visual-kit.pdf` — printable export of the same canvas
- `unica-visual-assets.zip` — SVG and ready-placement download used by the page
- `unica-visual-kit-desktop.png` and `unica-visual-kit-mobile.png` — previews

Open `index.html` directly. No network connection is required.
The production plugin icon is not changed by this package.

The link cards of the published site are not here. Each page carries its own,
set from that page's own heading, under `docs/pages/og/`; they are drawn by
`scripts/dev/render-social-cards.py`. The `ads/` banner is not the card to
point `og:image` at — it is 1200×628 and speaks for every page at once.

## Palette

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue | `#2563EB` | Mark fill, primary buttons, links on light surfaces |
| Blue on ink | `#7FA8E0` | Links and accents on dark surfaces: the site in dark theme, dark IDE panels. Fills keep plain Blue |
| Signal | `#93C5FD` | The mark's dot, small accents, highlights on Blue |
| Ink | `#0F172A` | Text on light surfaces, dark backgrounds |
| Paper | `#F8FAFC` | Page background |
| Neutral 200 | `#D8DEE8` | Rules and borders |
| Neutral 500 | `#64748B` | Secondary text |

`Blue on ink` exists because plain Blue on Ink reads as a fill, not as a link: white text on it is legible, blue text next to it is not. Keep fills on Blue and move text accents to Blue on ink.
